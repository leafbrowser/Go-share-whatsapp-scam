Hey, there's this scam app going around India called "Go Share WhatsApp" that people need to watch out for. It's totally fake, but it's tricking folks by stealing two big names.

First, they're pretending the app is an official product from Meta (the company behind WhatsApp). Second, they're ripping off the trademark name "Go Share" – which, as you probably know, is the name of a legitimate ride-sharing/delivery driver app.

Their pitch? They promise users can earn up to ₹50,000 through their platform. Sounds too good to be true, right? Well, it is. The "how" is where it gets dangerous: they claim you can make money by sharing access to your actual WhatsApp account, usually by scanning a QR code through their app or website.

This isn't just theory. I read on a forum where someone shared how doing this got their WhatsApp account banned. That's a serious consequence!

What's really concerning is how popular this scam seems to be. It's spreading in India, and shockingly, some small YouTubers are even promoting it. There's also a detailed article by a guy named Sambhav breaking down exactly how the scam operates.

Adding to the problem, their website ranks at the top in Indian search results for the keyword "go share". It's crazy that a fake site can outrank the real Go Share app, making it way easier for people to stumble into this trap.
